Utilities for loading files of different types

Most of this code aims to provide a layer of abstraction around library-specific loading and saving to make operations such as loading arrays from movie files and saving arrays to hdf files easy. 

This library is a dependency for several other libraries in the Pieces of Mind lab (https://github.com/piecesofmindlab/)
